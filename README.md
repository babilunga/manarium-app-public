# Manarium _(preview repo)_
> You can take a look at the web application _[here][manarium app]_ hosted on **Heroku**.

Manarium is a platform designed and developed to create opportunities for mini-game developers to:

- show their games to wide audience
- get feedback from thousands of active players
- make money from their games
- to be a part of the rapidly growing community of game developers and crypto-investors.


It is the place where gamers can have fun and earn money.
Investors can get early access to gamyfi projects and multiply their founds.
